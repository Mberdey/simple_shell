0x16. C - Simple Shell

A simple shell, also known as a command-line shell or a basic shell, is a program that provides a text-based interface for interacting with an operating system. It allows users to enter commands, executes them, and displays the results.

A shell typically provides functionalities such as:

1. Command execution: The shell interprets user input as commands and executes them. It searches for the command in the system's executable directories and runs the corresponding program.

2. Input/Output redirection: The shell allows redirecting input and output streams of commands. For example, it enables sending the output of a command to a file or using the contents of a file as input for a command.

3. Pipelines: Shell pipelines allow chaining multiple commands together, where the output of one command serves as input to the next command in the sequence. This feature enables powerful command composition.

4. Environment variables: Shells manage environment variables that hold information such as paths, settings, and configurations. They provide utilities for setting, getting, and modifying environment variables.

5. Scripting support: Shells often support scripting capabilities, allowing users to write scripts or shell programs that execute a series of commands in a batch mode.

6. Job control: Some shells offer job control features, allowing users to manage multiple processes, switch between them, pause/resume execution, and control their execution state.

Popular examples of simple shells include the Bourne shell (sh), C shell (csh), Korn shell (ksh), and the widely used Bash shell (Bourne Again SHell).

The primary purpose of a simple shell is to provide an interactive interface for users to interact with the operating system, execute commands, and perform various tasks efficiently and flexibly
